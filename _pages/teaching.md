### 📚 Courses

- **Programming for Data Science**  
  Introduces algorithms and programming for large-scale data analysis, covering PCA, clustering, Markov chains, supervised learning, neural networks, and parallel computing, with implementation in R.

### 🧭 Teaching Philosophy

I believe in **active learning** through hands-on exercises, real-world data applications, and an emphasis on critical thinking. My teaching aims to create an inclusive and supportive environment where all students feel encouraged to participate, challenge ideas, and achieve their full potential.
