I work on statistical modeling, machine learning, and network science. My research explores the intersection of structure, data, and algorithms, with a focus on both theoretical understanding and real-world applications.

### ðŸ“Œ Current Research Directions

- **Network Models**  
  Directed and undirected models with reciprocity, transitivity, and latent structure.
  
- **Graphon and Exchangeable Structures**  
  Nonparametric models for large networks using graphon and graphex processes.

- **Pairwise Comparison Models**  
  Low-rank and structured models for ranking and comparison data.

- **Human-Centred Foundation Models**  
  Statistical perspectives for safe, interpretable, and collaborative AI systems (UKâ€“Japan collaboration).
