I am an academic statistician interested in developing new methods for analyzing large complex data that are high-dimensional, correlated, and/or networked in nature.

I have worked at various institutes including National University of Singapore, Peking University, University of Munich, and University of Warwick. 

I received a bachelor's degree in Mathematics from the [University of Science and Technology of China (USTC)](https://www.ustc.edu.cn/) and PhD in Statistics from the [University of Wisconsin-Madison](https://www.wisc.edu/).

I am an Elected Member of the [International Statistical Institute](https://isi-web.org/) and a Fellow of the [Institute of Mathematical Statistics](https://imstat.org/). My past experience includes chairing the Research Section of the Royal Statistical Society and co-directing the Oxford-Warwick Statistics Centre for Doctoral Training.
