**Brief Bio**

I am a statistician and machine learning researcher working at the intersection of statistics, machine learning, and data science. My research develops new theory and methodology for analyzing large, complex, and high-dimensional datasets. Areas of focus include high-dimensional inference, network and graph-based models, structured and correlated data, nonparametric and computational methods, and statistical foundations of AI.

I am Chair Professor of Statistics and Machine Learning in the [Department of Applied Mathematics (AMA)](https://www.polyu.edu.hk/ama/) at the [Hong Kong Polytechnic University (PolyU)](https://www.polyu.edu.hk/). I have held academic positions at leading institutions worldwide, including the [National University of Singapore (NUS)](https://www.nus.edu.sg/), [Peking University (PKU)](https://www.pku.edu.cn/), the [University of Munich (LMU)](https://www.en.uni-muenchen.de/), and the [University of Warwick](https://warwick.ac.uk/).  

I received my bachelor's degree in Mathematics from the [University of Science and Technology of China (USTC)](https://math.ustc.edu.cn/), and a Ph.D. in Statistics from the [University of Wisconsinâ€“Madison](https://stat.wisc.edu/).  

I am a [Fellow of the Institute of Mathematical Statistics (IMS)](https://imstat.org/) and an [Elected Member of the International Statistical Institute (ISI)](https://isi-web.org/). I have also been a Humboldt Fellow and an Inaugural Turing Fellow at the Alan Turing Institute. My previous leadership roles include Chair of the Research Section of the Royal Statistical Society and Co-Director of the Oxfordâ€“Warwick Statistics Centre for Doctoral Training. I currently serve as Associate Editor for the *Journal of Computational and Graphical Statistics* and *Computational Statistics & Data Analysis*, and previously served on the editorial board of the *Journal of the Royal Statistical Society: Series B*.

### ðŸš€ Whatâ€™s New

I am actively recruiting **PhD students, postdoctoral fellows, and summer interns** with strong mathematical and statistical foundations, and a genuine curiosity for **theory-driven advances in modern data science**.

### For Prospective PhD Students

I am particularly interested in candidates with rigorous training in mathematics, statistics, or computer science. 
**I strongly encourage prospective PhD applicants to familiarize themselves with my recent papers.** 

### How to Apply

If you are interested in joining our team, please email me at ðŸ“§ [chenlei.leng@polyu.edu.hk](mailto:chenlei.leng@polyu.edu.hk) with your **CV** and a **research statement**.

- **For PhD applicants,** your research statement is crucial. I am most interested in:
  - **Your specific research interests**
  - **Your perspective on open problems in my field**

  > This helps me understand your critical thinking and motivation beyond a restatement of my published work.

- Details on PhD scholarships and admission procedures can be found at the [PolyU Graduate School](https://www.polyu.edu.hk/gs/).

While I may not be able to reply to every message, I carefully review all applications and will reach out to those who are a strong fit.
