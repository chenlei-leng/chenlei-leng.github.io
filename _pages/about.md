**Brief Bio**

I am a statistician developing new methods for analyzing large, complex datasetsâ€”particularly those that are high-dimensional, correlated, or network-structured.

I am Chair Professor of Statistics and Machine Learning in the [Department of Applied Mathematics (AMA)](https://www.polyu.edu.hk/ama/) at the [Hong Kong Polytechnic University (PolyU)](https://www.polyu.edu.hk/). I have held academic positions at several institutions, including the [National University of Singapore (NUS)](https://www.nus.edu.sg/), [Peking University (PKU)](https://www.pku.edu.cn/), the [University of Munich (LMU)](https://www.en.uni-muenchen.de/), and the [University of Warwick](https://warwick.ac.uk/).


I received my bachelor's degree in Mathematics from the [University of Science and Technology of China (USTC)](https://math.ustc.edu.cn/), and a Ph.D. in Statistics from the [University of Wisconsinâ€“Madison](https://stat.wisc.edu/).

I am an Elected Member of the [International Statistical Institute (ISI)](https://isi-web.org/) and a Fellow of the [Institute of Mathematical Statistics (IMS)](https://imstat.org/). My previous roles have included chairing the Research Section of the Royal Statistical Society, co-directing the Oxfordâ€“Warwick Statistics Centre for Doctoral Training, and serving as an inaugural Turing Fellow at the Alan Turing Institute. I serve as Associate Editor for the Journal of Statistical and Graphical Statistics and Computational Statistics & Data Analysis, and previously for the Journal of the Royal Statistical Society: Series B.
