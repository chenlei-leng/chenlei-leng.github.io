I am an academic statistician interested in developing new methods for analyzing large complex data that are high-dimensional, correlated, and/or networked in nature.

I have worked at various institutes including National University of Singapore, Peking University, University of Munich, and University of Warwick. 

I received a bachelor's degree in mathematics from the University of Science and Technology of China (USTC) and PhD in statistics from the University of Wisconsin-Madison.

I am an Elected Member of the International Statistical Institute and a Fellow of the Institute of Mathematical Statistics. My past experience includes chairing the Research Section of the Royal Statistical Society and co-directing the Oxford-Warwick Statistics CDT.
