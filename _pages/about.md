**About Me**

I am an academic statistician developing new methods for analyzing large, complex datasets—particularly those that are high-dimensional, correlated, or network-structured.

I am Chair Professor of Statistics and Machine Learning in the [Department of Applied Mathematics (AMA)](https://www.polyu.edu.hk/ama/) at the [Hong Kong Polytechnic University](https://www.polyu.edu.hk/). I have held academic positions at several institutions, including the [National University of Singapore](https://www.nus.edu.sg/), [Peking University](https://www.pku.edu.cn/), the [University of Munich (LMU)](https://www.en.uni-muenchen.de/), and the [University of Warwick](https://warwick.ac.uk/).


I received my bachelor's degree in Mathematics from the [University of Science and Technology of China (USTC)](https://math.ustc.edu.cn/), and a Ph.D. in Statistics from the [University of Wisconsin–Madison](https://stat.wisc.edu/).

I am an Elected Member of the [International Statistical Institute (ISI)](https://isi-web.org/) and a Fellow of the [Institute of Mathematical Statistics (IMS)](https://imstat.org/). My previous roles include chairing the Research Section of the Royal Statistical Society and co-directing the Oxford–Warwick Statistics Centre for Doctoral Training.
